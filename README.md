#### Please add your comments below in case your implementation is not fully working:

I found red-black trees too difficult to implement, so I have used implementation from online: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/red-black-tree-set-3-delete-2/

Tests are written in the function other_tests() in test.cpp
Memory leaks are removed.
All files work.
